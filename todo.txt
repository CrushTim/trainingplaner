exercise foundation notes:
    in provider the list tile edit and delete button suck ass (something else instead of size box)

workout view:
    session
        right mapping of emphasis
    excercise
        non expanded: fix button layout 

selection:
    update test mit return of id 

BUG: 
    -> isNew in session: will eigentlich über map prüfen, kann ich aber nicht, da die objektreferenz sich irgendwo ändert
        -> prompt look through the whole provider class and explain to me how the hashcode is different. following my logic i get all the sessions from the stream, map the planned ones to the keys in the map, add the unplanned ones into unplanned sessions and then map every unplanned session which has a plannedsession id to the according key value. where do i change the pointer so the hash code changes 

    
    1REPMAX.
    make exercise foundation more perfomant
