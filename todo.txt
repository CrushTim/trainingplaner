CRNT 

    when offline
        -> enable persistend updates on the exercises - make offline handling for every object (sessions, exercises exist in sessionprovider);
            -> safe sessions in provider
                make exercise changes  with update of session in a transaction, not update the selected session
            ->safe the notes changes
            ->safe the 1rm changes
        

    cycle planning view:
    -> add planning of exercises in a "workout view" as a dialog
        -> copy all planned exercises and insert the ids into the new session, then insert the new session (can also just update the session)
    -> add the change in intensity functionality -> apply change in %of1rmto all exercises in the week
            -> ask for changes in set x reps (eg change from 4x6 at 80% to 5x4 at 90%)
    -> add deload functionality -> apply half of reps for all exercises in the week


    -> copy week sessions option disabled first and if copied sessions are not empty make it enabled and the add a copy of every session with exercises and progressive overload function
   

    
    -the fucking exercise foundation performance is horrible 

    TEST everything


BUG: 
    -> isNew in session: will eigentlich über map prüfen, kann ich aber nicht, da die objektreferenz sich irgendwo ändert
        -> prompt look through the whole provider class and explain to me how the hashcode is different. following my logic i get all the sessions from the stream, map the planned ones to the keys in the map, add the unplanned ones into unplanned sessions and then map every unplanned session which has a plannedsession id to the according key value. where do i change the pointer so the hash code changes 

    
code dept:
    -> test of return value of add in trainingsplaner provider (tried to do it, expected "", but got dummy stuff returned)
