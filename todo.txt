selection:
    update test mit return of id 


BUG: 
    -> isNew in session: will eigentlich über map prüfen, kann ich aber nicht, da die objektreferenz sich irgendwo ändert
        -> prompt look through the whole provider class and explain to me how the hashcode is different. following my logic i get all the sessions from the stream, map the planned ones to the keys in the map, add the unplanned ones into unplanned sessions and then map every unplanned session which has a plannedsession id to the according key value. where do i change the pointer so the hash code changes
