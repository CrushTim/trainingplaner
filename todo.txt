Connectivity Service

    when offline
        -> enable persistend updates on the exercises - make offline handling for every object (sessions, exercises exist in sessionprovider);
            -> safe sessions in provider
                make exercise changes  with update of session in a transaction, not update the selected session
            ->safe the notes changes
            ->safe the 1rm changes
       


TEST everything
    
code dept:
    -> test of return value of add in trainingsplaner provider (tried to do it, expected "", but got dummy stuff returned)

    delete in workout view needs a refresh after doing one

    the text fields in add_session_dialog and workout view make them a widget 










Front End ideas:

    On adding 
        -planned session -> expand the container into the dialog or expand the container and fill with edit fields 

    workout view:
        -execise tile: on expand expand the bottom part and keep the top part
