    richtige reihenfolge der exercises in der session anzeigen (wahrscheinlich irgendwo in den mapping funktionen)

    -TEST THIS IF THIS WORKS make sure the exercises get deleted if the for add session is not added 

    after hitting the end at the foundations load the new ones into the list 
    
    -the fucking exercise foundation performance is horrible 

    when offline
        -> enable persistend updates on the exercises - make offline handling for every object (sessions, exercises exist in sessionprovider);
            -> safe sessions in provider
                make exercise changes  with update of session in a transaction, not update the selected session
            ->safe the notes changes
            ->safe the 1rm changes
       

    TEST everything


BUG: 
    -> isNew in session: will eigentlich über map prüfen, kann ich aber nicht, da die objektreferenz sich irgendwo ändert
        -> prompt look through the whole provider class and explain to me how the hashcode is different. following my logic i get all the sessions from the stream, map the planned ones to the keys in the map, add the unplanned ones into unplanned sessions and then map every unplanned session which has a plannedsession id to the according key value. where do i change the pointer so the hash code changes 

    
code dept:
    -> test of return value of add in trainingsplaner provider (tried to do it, expected "", but got dummy stuff returned)


    the text fields in add_session_dialog and workout view make them a widget 










Front End ideas:

    On adding 
        -planned session -> expand the container into the dialog or expand the container and fill with edit fields 

    workout view:
        -execise tile: on expand expand the bottom part and keep the top part
