PLANNED AND ACTUAL WORKFLOW

by design, my app works in the way so that if the current selected workout gets actual exercises, there will be a copy generated from the seleted planned 
session and each exercise that gets updated in workout view expanded part, an actual exercise copy is also created. 
These actual and planned exercises and session will be used to compare and display the planned exercises and the actual exercises.
Maybe make a map after resolving the stream in which a planned workout gets mapped to the actual workouts if they exist.
 maybe add a planned workout id attribute to the session bus to make those mappings possible. do the same for exercises.
now when the session gets updated in the button in the workout view, we need to check if a planned exercise and session exist and
if not, create them, otherwise update them



todo add function to sessionprovider for non selected or for  add stuff
    make the mapping of exercises to list of ids in bus so it adds right 
    
use methods to update when doing actual and planned logic
