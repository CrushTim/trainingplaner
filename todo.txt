    bugfix:

        workout view:
            when offline
                -> enable persistend updates on the exercises

            when returning online:
                    -> make unplannedforsession and trainingsessions stuff update or add dependent on isonline and if the exercise existed before
                -> make the updates persistent, and delete the temp exercises
                
                working on existing offline exercises does not update when returning online

                when returning online it also adds the temp exercise ids to the session update in the database
            

        session edit fields:
            date is wrong when init

        trainingexercise provider:
            -reset controller

        

    cycle planning view:

    test planned and actual exercise mapping and functionality

       copy week sessions
       insert doesnt work check if copy is right and then bugfix insert
                -> make insert week option disabled first and if copied sessions are not empty make it enabled and the add a copy of every session with exercises and progressive overload function
    make advanced planning functionality
        -> copy session with all exercises
        
        -> copy session with exercises and added progressive overload

Code dept

exercise foundation notes:
    in provider the list tile edit and delete button suck ass (something else instead of size box)

workout view:
    session
        right mapping of emphasis
    excercise
        non expanded: fix button layout 

selection:
    update test mit return of id 

BUG: 
    -> isNew in session: will eigentlich über map prüfen, kann ich aber nicht, da die objektreferenz sich irgendwo ändert
        -> prompt look through the whole provider class and explain to me how the hashcode is different. following my logic i get all the sessions from the stream, map the planned ones to the keys in the map, add the unplanned ones into unplanned sessions and then map every unplanned session which has a plannedsession id to the according key value. where do i change the pointer so the hash code changes 

    
    1REPMAX.
    make exercise foundation more perfomant
